<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://cipppp.github.io/bazaroo/)

I really liked to work at this project because it keeps me learning and devloping nice stuff. Unfortunately I dedicate just a single day because I have fk school and of course a lot of exams... I hope I will, in fact I will really continue to finish this project because it's pretty and I don't like to let things unfinished.
The most important thing I learned in this one-day venture if I can call it like that, is that no matter how smart you are, or how talented you are, if you really want to do something and do it the best as you can you need to work hard.
I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
